  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font.
  # For example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Plus Jakarta Sans
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/PlusJakartaSans-Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
